Hi there, Iâ€™m Zachary. I first got into web development in 2021 using plain HTML, CSS, Javascript to build basic projects. Afterwards i got into learning javascript frameworks such as React and Next.js (React framework).

I try my best to be productive whenever possible and love to make new friends.

**ðŸ’» Development**  

Since starting my journey into web development, I realized that building websites are not as easy as i thought. I am interested in learning the logic behind certain components in a website. It is really satisfying applying what i've learnt when building my own components in my apps.
